Through Statera, students can assess and submit their current stress levels to their coaches to build practice regimens considerate of their students’ academic workloads.\n  </div>\n  <div className=\"image-box\">\n  <Fade duration={3000}>\n    <img src={Scoreboard} alt=\"Scoreboard at Gateway High School pool\"/>\n    <img src={JourneyMapping} alt=\"My team plotting out our user journey maps\"/>\n    </Fade>\n  </div>\n  <div className=\"center-content\">\n  <div className=\"section-header\">AND NOW FOR SOME CONTEXT</div><br/><br/>\n    <strong>About the project:  </strong>\n  My team was asked to build a responsive website for a problem within “youth sports” as part of a six week project in our Interaction Design class. It was our task to go into the field and identify pain points, generate solutions, and create a mid-to-hi-fi prototype of our website.<br/><br/>\n\n    <strong>My role:  </strong><br/>\n    <strong>Guerilla and background research   </strong>- I took to the streets of Pittsburgh and asked people their experiences around youth sports.<br/><br/>\n\n    <strong>Research synthesis   </strong>- Clustered research findings and transformed them into personas and customer journey maps.<br/><br/>\n\n    <strong>Ideation  </strong> - generated storyboards and speed dated those ideas to gauge their validity.<br/><br/>\n\n    <strong>Solutioning  </strong> - Created wireframes and a prototype for our end product.\n\n  </div>\n  <div className=\"center-content\">\n  <div className=\"section-header\"> DISCOVERY AND UNDERSTANDING</div><br/><br/>\n  <strong>  Finding the right problem to solve:</strong><br/>\n  Our team performed guerilla research and interviewed residents within Pittsburgh on their experiences around youth sports. We spoke to volunteer coaches, former student athletes, and parents during our research process. Across these groups, we uncovered a similar story in the student athlete experience: while athletes didn’t lose their passion towards sports, they felt too much pressure in balancing academics and athletics to continue pursuing it during their education.\n  </div>\n  <div className=\"quote-box\"><Fade duration={3000}><div className=\"quote\">\"While my son had to stop swimming on a team so he could focus on his classes, he never stopped loving to swim. He continues to find time every week to head to the pool.\"\n  -Mom of two swimmers</div></Fade>\n  </div>\n  <div className=\"center-content\">\nAs swimming happened to be the seasonal sport currently in progress in Pittsburgh, we chose to focus our research on the young swimmer’s experience. On our weekend, we hitched an Uber to the Pittsburgh suburbs to observe a Monroeville Marlins swim meet. It was early winter, but we were welcomed with a wave of humid air immediately after stepping into that gym.</div>\n<div className=\"center-content\">\n<div className=\"section-header\"> FINDINGS</div><br/><br/>\nAs our team performed interviews and observations, we’d come together to discuss what we did know and what gaps we had in our knowledge about the swim team experience. Through these conversations, we created journey maps that highlighted how coaches and swimmers (along with their parents) navigated through a week of practice and competitions.<br/><br/>\n\nUltimately, we highlighted three critical insights that were important for what we chose to build a website solving:<br/><br/>\n\n-Swim coaches spend their time during meets standing right by the edge of the pool. They are busy focusing on their students. Using a website during a meet would not only be dangerous, it would also distract them from their role as a coach.<br/><br/>\n\n-The downtime during swim meets offers a lot of opportunity for swimmers to do school work, but the loudness of the gym and wanting to show support for your team can take away from that.<br/><br/>\n\n-Swim meets generate a lot of useful data for coaches through heat sheets. This information is constantly being updated through the meet but could be giving coaches more value.\n</div>\n<div className=\"image-box\">\n<Fade duration={3000}>\n  <img src={SwimmerJourneyMap} alt=\"Journey map of swimmer's experience\"/>\n  <img src={CoachJourneyMap} alt=\"Journey map of coach's experience\"/>\n  </Fade>\n</div>\n<div className=\"center-content\">\n<div className=\"section-header\"> SPEED DATING</div><br/><br/>\nAfter discussing our research as a team, we identified four main opportunity areas for building a website around. These included:<br/><br/>\n\n<ol>\n<li>How might we avoid overwhelming the coach with too many questions and trying to interpret multiple heat sheets?</li>\n<li>How might we effectively communicate with swimmers about matters that need attention during the meet?</li>\n<li>How might we keep our athletes well balanced to avoid them from getting overworked and burning out?</li>\n<li>How might we get there on time for my kid's event without having to stay the entire time?</li>\n<li>How might we prepare the correct warm-up, advice and medley choice for swimmers before day two of the meet?</li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"img-text-box blue-grey\">\n  <div><img src={Responsive} alt=\"Journey map of swimmer's experience\"/></div>\n  <div className=\"img-text-text\"><strong>Building Responsiveness</strong><br/>\nWe chose to create a responsive website that would allow coaches and students to allocate energy that felt appropriate to their environment. When coaches prepare for practices, this usually involves carefully reviewing past heat sheets, student records, and building off this data, which means this work typically isn’t completed on a mobile phone. However, we wanted to give coaches the opportunity to review any information around students that they might need refreshing while at the pool.</div>\n</div>\n<div className=\"img-text-box\">\n<div className=\"img-text-text\"><strong>Stress Assessment</strong><br/>\nInitial feedback we got from our stress assessment was that it failed to account for students uncomfortable with disclosing personal information, as well as student who wouldn’t have a framework for assesing their own stress levels. Incorporating this feedback, we generated a survey that students could use to build into this. </div>\n  <div><video height=\"500px\" autoplay>\n  <source src={StressAssessment} type=\"video/webm\" />\nYour browser does not support the video tag.\n</video></div>\n</div>\n  </div>\n  </div>\n<Footer />\n</div>\n)\n","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/stressassessment-835921aa12e64f8c53342ea6972d7dd7.webm\";","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/statera-scoreboard-523d1bc58ef0539766abfb70cb602f3e.png\";"],"sourceRoot":""}

I will be graduating from Carnegie Mellon University's Masters of Human-Computer Interaction in August 2020.<br/><br/>\n      Previously I worked in marketing and community management for startups in educational technology. Somewhere in between that and CMU, I also worked retail in auto repair and supermarkets. There is a zen to cutting cabbage unlike any Headspace session. <br/><br/>\n      In my free time, I like to DJ ambient records, teach myself to program, and go running when it's not too cold outside.</p>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n  </div>\n  </div>\n)\n","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/msilvestre-b8b00000ca5fb584fd668737bfdd190e.jpg\";"],"sourceRoot":""}

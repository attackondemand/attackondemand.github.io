My experiences engaging with customers and product teams inspired me to transition to the UX field. <br/> <br/>\n\nMost recently, I graduated from Carnegie Mellon University’s Masters in Human-Computer Interaction program where I worked with Honda R&D Americas to build design thinking tools. I’m currently looking for Product Design roles that blend research, design, and strategy. I love to wear many hats and learn new things (for instance, I taught myself React JS to code this very portfolio), a curiosity which extends to how I enter every problem space I enter as a designer. <br/> <br/>\n\nWhen I’m not in Figma or testing prototypes with users, I like to DJ ambient records, watch Wong Kar Wai movies, and get ever more closer to cooking the perfect tomato sauce.\n\n</p>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n  </div>\n  <Footer />\n\n  </div>\n)\n","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/msilvestre-b8b00000ca5fb584fd668737bfdd190e.jpg\";"],"sourceRoot":""}

The first half of our research was individually focused, exploring the pre-existing research completed by Metro21, then we worked within teams to build off the insights we gained to identify a new solution for the project.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"content-photo-right\">\n  <div className=\"col\">\n    <h3>Problem</h3>\n    <p>Public art is an expensive endeavor for a city to undertake and maintain. Though it can be well-intentioned, these installations often exist in the background of people’s lives. Many people might recognize an installation as a landmark within their daily commute, there is little encouragement for Pittsburgh residents to further engage or seek out information regarding these pieces. </p>\n  </div>\n  <img src=\"northshore-playground.jpg\" alt=\"playground in north shore\" />\n</div>\n<div className=\"content-photo-left\">\n<img src=\"speeddating-me.jpg\" alt=\"participating in speed dating\" />\n  <div className=\"col\">\n    <h3>My Role</h3>\n    <p>While our group focused on splitting user research evenly so that we would get differing perspectves on interviews and questions, I also took on the role as Archiver for the group. I chose this position as I wanted to improve my ability at documenting my processes within groups. For each activity, I took photographs and video for us to use within our interpretation sessions and deliverable materials. </p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"center-content\">\n    <h3>Methods</h3>\n    <p>Observe and Intercept     |     Think Aloud Protocol     |     Speed Dating     |     Experience Prototyping</p>\n    <p>After coming together as a team, our group identified a series of topics that we wanted to get further insight into:</p>\n    <span className=\"bold\">Memorability:</span> What makes a public art experience impactful for residents and tourists that they associate public art with the city?<br /><br />\n\n    <span className=\"bold\">Interest: </span>Why are people brought in to public art installations? How does that shape their interaction with the cityscape itself?<br /><br />\n\n    <span className=\"bold\">Activity: </span>When people visit public art, what exactly are they doing? How do they interact with the public art and what do they need to have their experience fulfilled?<br /><br />\n</div>\n\n<div>\n<h3>Observe and Intercept</h3>\nTo answer these questions, we went out to Agnes R. Katz Plaza and did observe and intercepts to better understand the problem space and answer some of these questions.  After speaking with both local residents and tourists, we came back together and discussed our findings, then synthesized that information within an affinity diagramming session. We broke down the individual components of our interviews, shuffled them together and looked for general patterns. The overarching takeaways were:<br /> <br />\n\n1. People have differing needs with which to feel supported with engaging in public art. Some people want the capability to learn factual information whereas other people want more experiential tools to socialize and interact with the art.<br /><br />\n\n2. Reidents do not typically seek out to engage with public art, but when they find themselves within new or novel spaces, an installation can invite them to change their routine or schedule in that moment.<br /><br />\n\n3. While poeple don't often remember the details of the art itself, but instead remember the experience they had because of the people they were with or the events that took place that day.<br /><br />\n</div>\n<div className=\"content-photo-right\">\n    <div className=\"col\">\n      <h3>Think Aloud Protocol</h3>\n      <p>At this point, we identified major trends in people’s experiences interacting with public art and we wanted to see how current technologies addressed those trends. Through Think Aloud Protocols, we did a competitive analysis of the city’s own resources for public art, as well as a tool for residents to document and share information about public art. While participants enjoyed that these sites were comprehensive, they felt as though the information was too dense to be helpful when trying to interact with public art using a mobile device. This fact was pivotal to our project. We realized that if we wanted to utilize information as a way to increase engagement, we would have to be extremely mindful of how it existed within the space people were interacted with the pieces.</p>\n    </div>\n    <img src=\"thinkaloud.png\" alt=\"think aloud protocol session\" />\n</div>\n<div className=\"content-photo-left\">\n  <img src=\"crazyeight.png\" alt=\"crazy eights session\" />\n  <div className=\"col\">\n  <h3>Crazy Eights</h3>\n    <p>Now that our team had a clear idea of “what is”, we used the crazy eights technique to validate what we found were important needs that weren’t being adequately met. As a group we synthesized those categories as:</p>\n    <ul>\n         <li>The need to learn about art from others</li>\n         <li>The need for social interaction through art</li>\n         <li>The need to create art and express yourself</li>\n        <li>The need to receive information in a more engaging way</li>\n         <li>The need to experience nature in an urban setting</li>\n    </ul>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"center-content\">\n<h3>Storyboards</h3>\n<img src=\"storyboard.png\" alt=\"example of storyboard\" />\n<p>We created storyboards to speed date these ideas and received the strongest response (both negatively and positively) to the need to experience nature in an urban setting. However, this conclusion was a bit too left-field for the scope of our client’s needs, so we chose to integrate some aspects of participant responses into our second most responsive idea, which was the need for social interaction.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"center-content\">\n<h3>Evidence</h3>\n<h2>“I just like to be with people...I like to share [my experience] with them.”</h2><br />\n<h2>“I feel like if I am by myself, I would think to myself but it wouldn’t be as enjoyable.”</h2><br />\n\n<h2>“I’ve never gone inside a place of art without other people.”</h2>\n</div>\n<h3>Insights</h3>\n<p>After our speed dating sessions, our group struggled to figure out what was the best direction to take our research for an experience prototype. To help guide us, we chose to synthesize our insights from each prior method and use those insights to create our solution. What we found was:</p>\n<p>\n1. People wanted a novel experience that allowed them to escape their daily routines.\n\n2. Rather than reading plaques, people preferred spending time directly interacting with the art.\n\n3. When people did visit public art, they wanted to share that experience with someone close to them.\n</p>\n<div class=\"photo-content\">\n  <img src=\"experience-prototype.png\" alt=\"experience prototype\" />\n  <img src=\"tiles.png\" alt=\"tiles\" />\n</div>\n<div className=\"content-photo-left\">\n<img src=\"solution.png\" alt=\"solution\" />\n<div className=\"col\">\n<h3>Solution</h3>\n<p>These findings led us to create the Art + Human circuit. We imagined a social experience built around public art that mimicked a circuit board, where people could step on tiles to create audio/visual experiences around the installations. We tested this with a mock-public art installation using Wizard of Oz interaction techniques where the installation would light up if two or more people stepped on the tiles.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"content-photo-right\">\n<div className=\"col\">\n<h3>Reflection</h3>\n<p>How to build on our prototype in future iterations:\nOur testers said they wanted further incentive for interacting with the art if they were alone, so we would plan to make the art installation lean in to the “puzzle” aspect for lone artgoers. Another important piece of feedback we received was taking into consideration time of day with our interactions, as the light was difficult to see in the middle of the day.\n</p>\n</div>\n<img src=\"postersession.png\" alt=\"poster session\" />\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<Footer />\n</div>\n)\n"],"sourceRoot":""}

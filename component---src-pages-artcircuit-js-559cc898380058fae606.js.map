Combining Pittsburgh’s cultural and historical identity with its technology-enriched future, the Circuit explores how public art can provide people the opportunity to break away from their daily routines, and to share those moments with the people around them.\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"image-box\">\n<Fade duration={3000}>\n  <img src={KatzEyes} />\n  <img src={Magnolias} />\n  </Fade>\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"center-content\">\n<div class=\"section-header\"> AND NOW FOR SOME CONTEXT</div><br/><br/>\n<strong>About the project</strong><br/>\nAs part of our User Research Methods and Evaluation class, we teamed up with the Metro21 Smart Cities Institute to address the topic of engagement with public art in Downtown Pittsburgh. The first half of our research was individually focused, exploring the pre-existing research completed by Metro21, then we worked within teams to build off the insights we gained to identify a new solution for the project.<br/><br/>\n\n\n<strong>What I did</strong><br/>\nWhile our group focused on splitting user research evenly so that we would get differing perspectives on interviews and questions, I also took on the role as Archiver for the group. I chose this position as I wanted to improve my ability at documenting my processes within groups. For each activity, I took photographs and video for us to use within our interpretation sessions and deliverable materials.\n</div>\n<div className=\"center-content\">\n<div class=\"section-header\"> DISCOVERY AND UNDERSTANDING<br/><br/>Observe and Intercept | Think Aloud Protocol | Speed Dating | Experience Prototyping</div><br/><br/>\n<strong>What we saw</strong><br/>\nPublic art is an expensive endeavor for a city to undertake and maintain. Though it can be well-intentioned, these installations often exist in the background of people’s lives. Many people might recognize an installation as a landmark within their daily commute, there is little encouragement for Pittsburgh residents to further engage or seek out information regarding these pieces.<br/><br/>\n\nTo get a better sense of how people interacted with public art (and since we were all transplants to Pittsburgh, actually get an opportunity to check it out), we headed to Downtown Pittsburgh. Here we were able to witness the different ways people ignored, photographed, climbed on top of the various installations peppered throughout the city. In addition to observing people, we also interviewed people to find what did or didn’t attract them to downtown’s public art.\n</div>\n<div class=\"quote-box\"><Fade duration={3000}><div className=\"quote\">\"It's important for space to have purpose to draw people to it, whether its for people taking a break from work to be on their phones or listening to music, it provides people an opportunity to interact with space rather than sitting in their urban silo.\"\n-Tourist from Vermont</div></Fade>\n</div>\n\n\n</div>\n</div>\n<Footer />\n</div>\n)\n","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/thinkaloud-1ac960637cd4fc27b07dca26538f7428.png\";","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/solution-b7c3179648f7ddc1b254c2efe34d4c45.png\";","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/tiles-aeea824d45af4635a3c30e2564c9ee30.png\";"],"sourceRoot":""}

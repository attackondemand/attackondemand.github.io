This was an eight month, end-to-end project from generative research out in the field to designing and testing hi-fidelity prototypes with stakeholders.<br/><br/>\n\n      <strong>My role: </strong><br/>\n      <strong>Team communications:</strong> I led content generation for our team’s Medium blog, as well as generating weekly reports for our client to keep them involved within our design process.<br/><br/>\n\n      <strong>Testing Lead:</strong> I created testing protocols through our design phase of the project to help us validate concepts and understand user behavior through our prototypes.<br/><br/>\n\n      <strong>Design research:</strong> To better understand which stakeholders and pain points to leverage, I led generation of design artifacts within the team including creation of user personas and customer journey maps.\n    </div>\n<div className=\"image-box salmon\">\n  <div className=\"section-header\">DISCOVERY</div><br/><br/>\n  <div className=\"box-content\">\n  <span className=\"serif-header\">Using Design Thinking to build Design Thinking tools</span><br/>\nWith the rise of electric and autonomous vehicles, the landscape for the automotive industry is rapidly changing. This means that even the biggest companies have to think creatively and innovatively about the work they're doing. To promote innovation, Honda has established a series of initiatives and orgs throughout their company to establish design thinking methodologies in their research. <br/> <br/>As a means of supporting these internal organizations, Honda R&D came to my team with the challenge to build an intelligent platform for learning design thinking. At the core of this challenge, our team was contracted to help their sponsorship with OnRamp, an externship program at Ohio State University where undergrad students use design thinking to research and idenitfy potential opportunity areas within a variety of problem spaces. <br/><br/>\nAs budding designers within UX, this was a very meta experience. We had to design a research plan that allowed us to go into the field but also step back and reflect on our own challenges learning these methods. With a problem space that was so close to our own education, we had to approach the statement \"You are not the user\" with a bit more ambiguity. <br/> <br/>\n<div className=\"gridRow\">\n<img className=\"stakeholder\" src={StakeholerMap} alt=\"responsive website\"/><br/> <br/>\n</div>\n<strong>To find out how we could best create value within our problem space, we established three goals in our research:</strong><br/><br/>\n\n<strong>1)</strong> Define the scope of our target users and determine which stakeholders had similar pain points<br/><br/>\n\n<strong>2)</strong>Understand how teams both in and outside of Honda take advantage of Design Thinking processes<br/><br/>\n\n<strong>3)</strong> Learn how teams collaborate and communicate ideas to drive innovation within their greater organization\n  </div>\n  <div className=\"grid-container\">\n    <div className=\"gridRow\">\n    <div className=\"gridUnit\">\n    <img src={StoryboardIcon} />\n    <span className=\"serif-header\">Storyboarding</span>\n    To help overcome this feedback loop, we sought out exploring our problem space through storyboarding. This allowed us to have discussions with people both familiar and unaware of design thinking processes to evaluate where they would be most comfortable within an intervention.\n\n    </div>\n\n    <div className=\"gridUnit\">\n    <img src={SemiStructureIcon} />\n    <span className=\"serif-header\">Semi-Structured Interviews</span>\nIn addition to storyboarding, we also spoke with a wide net of stakeholders ranging from mechanical engineers at Honda, students within Honda’s OSU internship program called OnRamp, and Design Thinking leaders and experts both at Honda and at other companies.\n\n    </div>\n    </div>\n    <div className=\"gridRow\">\n    <div className=\"gridUnit\">\n    <img src={CompIcon} />\n    <span className=\"serif-header\">Competitive Analysis</span>\nResearched and explored over 50 project management, design, and collaboration softwares to see what needs were already addressed and which could use further intervention.\n    </div>\n\n    <div className=\"gridUnit\">\n    <img src={LitReviewIcon} />\n    <span className=\"serif-header\">Lit Review</span>\nWe read through case studies of Design Thinking initiatives at other companies, as well as understanding topics around collaboration, artificial intelligence, persuasion and knowledge management systems.\n    </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n  </div>\n  <div className=\"center-content\">\n  <div className=\"section-header\">SYNTHESIS</div><br/><br/>\n\n  <span className=\"serif-header\">We constructed personas to help scope our target users</span>\n  While going out into the field, our team compiled our research through affinity clustering so that we could better understand user behaviors. Through the knowledge we surfaced from our clustering activity, I led our team in building user personas we could use to create alignment with our client on who we were building a tool for. As our client wanted us to imagine a solution that scaled to help teams outside of Honda, we used these personas throughout our proces to assess what needs were most compatible across experience level, job and education background, and personality type. What we found was that individual styles of behavior weren’t as important as how people wanted to implement and use design thinking within their daily workflows.\n\n    </div>\n\n    <div className=\"center-content\">\n    <span className=\"serif-header\">Facilitator Personas</span>\n    We developed three personas around the facilitators of Design Thinking workshops. What we found notable about these groups is that most differences weren’t between individual facilitators’ behaviors, but between the modes in which they operate in the different types of workshops they teach.\n\n    <div className=\"gridRow\">\n    <div className=\"gridUnit\">\n    <img className=\"persona\" src={Ben} />\n    <span className=\"serif-header\">Ben</span>\n    <strong>Fundamentals Instructor</strong>\n  \"I want to teach employees about Design Thinking to help them center their research around the customer.\"\n    </div>\n    <div className=\"gridUnit\">\n    <img className=\"persona\" src={Megan} />\n    <span className=\"serif-header\">Megan</span>\n    <strong>Practitioner Training</strong>\n  \"Design Thinking takes practice.
